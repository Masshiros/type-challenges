<h1>Pop </h1>

> TypeScript 4.0 is recommended in this challenge

Implement a generic `Pop<T>` that takes an Array `T` and returns an Array without it's last element.

For example

```ts
type arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
type arr2 = [3, 2, 1]

type re1 = Pop<arr1> // expected to be ['a', 'b', 'c']
type re2 = Pop<arr2> // expected to be [3, 2]
```

**Extra**: Similarly, can you implement `Shift`, `Push` and `Unshift` as well?
