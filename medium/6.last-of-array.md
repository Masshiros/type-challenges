<h1>Last of Array </h1>

> TypeScript 4.0 is recommended in this challenge

Implement a generic `Last<T>` that takes an Array `T` and returns its last element.

For example

```ts
type arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
type arr2 = [3, 2, 1]

type tail1 = Last<arr1> // expected to be 'c'
type tail2 = Last<arr2> // expected to be 1
```
